Git Cheatsheet - John Ettipio

-clone:    coppies a remote repository (repo) to the folder the command is run in
example:   git clone https://github.com/JohnCE777/ESD2_Group_Project_2025


-pull:     Run this command in the folder with your repo and it will update your local copy with the remote version
           !ALWAYS RUN THIS COMMAND BEFORE YOU START WORKING TO ENSURE THERE AREN'T MERGE CONFLICTS!
example:   git pull


-add:      Adds the files you created to the staging area
example:   git add * [* adds all files; usually what you want]


-commit:   Adds you changes to a new version of the LOCAL repo
example:   git commit -m "Created a function to average 3 numbers" [use -m and quotes as show to describe the change you made]


-push:     Updates the remote repository with the changes you commited
example:   git push


The typical workflow after you have established the repo is
[change something] > git add * > git commit -m "description of change" > git push

Always pull when you start working, push your changes often, give meaningful commit descriptions (best practice is <=50 chars)

Happy Gitting!
